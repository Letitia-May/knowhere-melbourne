Use Google Maps JavaScript API in code and customise
	- create unique key in google developers site
	- copy code into HTML, CSS and JavaScript
	- enter key into script tags
	- change lat and lng to Melbourne
	- change map width so it does not take up entire body and float right

Create JSON file to store POIs (GeoJSON?)
	- only 2 initially to test (1000 Pound Bend and Naked for Satan)
	- include coordinates (lat and lng)
	- include POI name, tags (e.g. rooftop, brunch), comments

Link JSON file to JS (and html?)

USE JSON VALIDATOR AND JSON GENERATOR

Use a for.each loop to get data for POIs

Display POI markers on map (as small, coloured dots)

Write HTML and CSS for search boxes and comments box
- comments box hidden until marker clicked on

Write JS function so when a search term is entered the map will display only POIs with matching term (use an if else statement?)
- filtering results (google maps embed api?)
- other markers are hidden

Customise style of markers (large and small, different colour for type of tag?)

POI marker to become larger when hovered over with mouse, and to remain large on click (JS and CSS)

On marker click, comments box to appear with POI information

Make responsive (see mobile wireframe for layout)



Need to look into: 

- can maps tell current location when on mobile? Work out how to search on set map area (e.g. search 'Rooftop' in 'Fitzroy')

- can I share marker data via text, facebook etc

- how can I get map to stay with marker in center for responsive site
